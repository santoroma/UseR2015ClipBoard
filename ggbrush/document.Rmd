This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r fig.height=3.5}
library(leaflet)
library(dplyr)
leaflet(quakes) %>%
  addTiles("https://api.tiles.mapbox.com/v4/mapbox.wheatpaste/{z}/{x}/{y}.png?access_token=pk.eyJ1Ijoic2FudG9yb21hIiwiYSI6ImUxN2ZkZWRkNTU2NjVlZjRiM2E2ZmZhNGQyODM0OGFhIn0.mM32XaR8Ro0dBQIlA6G2iA") %>%
  addCircles(color = "#CC0000", weight = 2, radius = ~10^mag / 5,
    popup = ~as.character(stations))
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE,eval=T}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
